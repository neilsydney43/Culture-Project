        <p>The Cloudsteppers speak in Latin and have been for millions of years. When they interacted with the Romans, they taught them their language, Lastio. Their numerical system is base 12. This means that instead of adding a digit every time you multiply by ten, you add a digit after the multiplication of twelve. The main reason is that the Cloudsteppers have six fingers on each hand. They read and write in Nordic runes. The Norse learned of the Cloudsteppers, and the Cloudsteppers guided them on their journeys. They are very generous, always helping other races that they find.</p>

       <h1>GOVERNMENT</h1>
       <div class="line"></div> 
       <p>The government of the Cloudsteppers is tricameral. The first is called Magicae. They are in charge of making magical laws. Powerful wizards are chosen to represent areas of the world. They come together and decide upon laws that the people should have. Next is Otium. This branch is in charge of maintaining peace among the people of Cloudia by making laws not related to magic. The last is Judicium. Judicium is in charge of enforcing the laws made by Magicae and Otium. People who break laws would be put in blackstone cells that cancel magic.</p>

        <h1>EDUCATION</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>School starts at the young age of three, where they learn how to read and write in latin, and learn basic math. The Cloudsteppers value expression of creativity, so art and music are introduced at a young age. Once they reach the age of 7, they will be encouraged to take up an instrument or art. If they do not want to, however, there are many options as to what they want to do. Once you reach the age of 12, you are transferred to a different school where you learn magic, along with more of the usual subjects. The first year is learning the basics of magic. Students get accustomed to the three types of magic shown above. At age thirteen, they have a choice to make. Stick with magic and choose one of the three types, or advance in other fields, such as biology, or astronomy.

        <h1>FOOD, CLOTHING, AND ART</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>The Cloudsteppers regularly wear tunics and sandals on a casual day. However, if it’s a more formal occasion, women regularly wear ball gowns, while men will wear tuxedos woven from cloudsilk. The richest people wear enchanted clothes sewn with cloudsilk. Some of these clothes have certain perks such as hats staying on your head even when you’re upside down, and gowns that sparkle no matter the conditions. The food of Cloudsteppers is primarily based on their main plant: Claudia. Soups, stews, currys, and much more can be made with claudia. There are many unique plants, which is why Cloudsteppers are vegetarian. Tapestries are sown by weavers, and they are often given to nobles. As stated before, children are introduced to the the arts at a young age, so there are many ways to express your creativity.

        <p>
            There are three types of magic in the world. Creatia(creation), Distoria(Destruction), and preservia(preservation). Let’s look at them separately.            
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="creatia">
        <h1>CREATIA
            </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            Creatia is mainly the creation of biomatter. This includes plants, the summoning of animals and if one is powerful enough, the creation of completely new living things. It may seem purely defensive, but is actually able to be used for offensive purposes. For example, the manipulation of plants can be to attack or even kill enemies. Some of the darkest forms include the creation of creatures that simply shouldn’t exist. Some of the most famous ones are the basilisk and chimera. These both were created by Enscrualda, a very powerful and very evil Creatia magician.            
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="distoria">
        <h1>DISTORIA
            </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            Distoria is the power of destruction, specifically through the six elements (shadow, light, fire, water, air, and earth). Distoria magicians are able to manipulate these elements in order to destroy things. Distoria magicians are less common because of the volatility of the six elements. One requires rigorous training in order to keep them in check. However, if you go through this, there is quite a bit in store for you. Distoria magicians can break through almost every substance in the universe. Of course, some take more time than others. Some of the hardest versions of Distoria magic are as follows: Weather manipulation, Mountain leveling, and creation of fire without oxygen.            
        </p>

    <section id="preservia">
        <h1>PRESERVIA
            </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            Preservia is the power of preservation. They are often used for defense. This form of magic uses two of the six elements, shadow and light, to keep this alive. This can range from creating force fields made from light to literally raising the dead with shadow magic. As you can see, there is definitely room for evil. One of the most evil magicians of all time, Dr. Nye, imbued dead people with shadow magic to create his own undead army. He didn’t stop at this, however. Using the animals that Enscrualda created, he killed them and brought them back to life, stronger than before. Eyewitnesses have said that he kills them himself, enjoying it greatly.
